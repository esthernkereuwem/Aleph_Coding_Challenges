# Aleph_Coding_Challenges
I solved these challenges as part of my entries to the 2021 Aleph fellowship program. I love science and technology, and I am proud of all I learned working on these. 
Both projects are written in Node Js. So you would need a Node environment to run both of them. You can also checkout the Repl.it links to run both of them instantly in the browser. 

Here is the breakdown:
  # - Question 1 - Tic Tac Toe:
       A special variant of the tic-tac-toe game where player X never loses. The programme is the Player X and you are Player O. The game only draws or the Player X wins. You cannot win the programme. Try to win it
       How to setup locally:
          `
            "dependencies": {
              "lodash": "^4.17.21",
              "prompt-sync": "^4.2.0"
          }
          `

 # - Question 3 - Most probable sum of numbers 1, 2, 4, 8 ... 64 chosen randomly:
       For this programme, the user selects a card at random and until the sum of the cards in their hands is > 124. We then have to repeat this selecting and addition process a couple of times to get the most probable sum. This programme accomplishes exactly that, in Node JS also. You can setup the local Node JS environment to test it, or you can just use to Repl link to get a feel of how it works.

I really learned a lot while researching how to solve this problems with help from my brother. I look forward to learning a lot more as an Aleph fellow.
